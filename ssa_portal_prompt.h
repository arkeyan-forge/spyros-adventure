// The prompt object (a function-local static of sub_82205D18) has its mode at +56 (2 while the portal screen is up, 4
// while a figure comes in, 0 in play); while the screen is up, the text it shows tells who is asked: the CRC-32 of the
// text's key in global.lxb, which does not depend on the language. Public facts: tsapZ/SSARecomp docs/runtime/host/portal.md (MIT);
// checked here against the running title.
