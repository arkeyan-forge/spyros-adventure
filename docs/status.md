# Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure (ssa)

> **Purpose:** which disc SSA needs, where the port stands, and where to start · **Status:** current (2026-10-28) · **Tags:** [SSA]

## Disc
| | |
|---|---|
| Release | 2011, Toys for Bob; Redump "USA, Europe" XGD3; 1142 files, 8.10 GB |
| Title ID, media ID, version | `415608AB`, `53CE7B97`, 0.0.0.2 |
| `default.xex` SHA-256 | `e195f513...` (full value: `games/ssa/game.txt`, `games/ssa/info.cpp`) |
| Engine | Lux + NGL, Bink 1, Wwise, XDK 2.0.20500 ([docs/engines/lux/README.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/engines/lux/README.md)) |

The user's disc stays outside git (`private/discs/` or the path in `SSA_ISO`); everything derived from it goes to
`private/ssa/`.

## Status
SSA is the reference port. It plays well on macOS (Metal, 30 fps at scale 2 in levels, 60 fps opt-in), works on
Windows on a real PC, builds and runs on Linux (Docker; Linux kit since Skylauncher 0.3.1). Skylauncher installs it
from the player's disc through the player kit (kit 0.5.0 builds SSA and Giants). The Toy Box, the shared collection,
the smart portal and the portal identity work. The Xbox UWP port is paused. Feature by feature:
[parity.md](parity.md); what is left: [100.md](100.md).
The game also plays from a copy of the disc's data, with no disc image (2026-10-26,
[game_data.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/runtime/host/game_data.md): 1142 files, 8.10 GB copied and verified in 16 s, then 1150
frames at 30 fps from the title).

## Where to start
- The engine: [docs/engines/lux/README.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/engines/lux/README.md); every address:
  [ssa_addresses.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/engines/lux/ssa_addresses.md); the archive with the evidence:
  [engine_notes.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/engines/lux/engine_notes.md).
- How the boot was won: [boot.md](boot.md); the traps: [gotchas.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/porting/gotchas.md).
- Running it: [testing.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/getting-started/testing.md) (isolated runs to `level_027`, the
  `tools/test_all.sh` harness); a subsystem's history: [docs/history/handoffs/](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/history/handoffs/README.md).
- Day-1 self-test: `tools/day1.sh ssa <iso>` (2026-10-24: 293/293 entries found, 291 at confidence 1.0, the hash matches).

## Story tour (2026-10-28) [SSA] [V]
Every story level of the disc, in chapter order (`text\<lang>\global.lxb`, the `Level_<n>_Chapter` and `Level_<n>`
keys): the 22 chapters, Lair of Kaos' second part (`level_010b`, loaded at the transition; its mission names the ending
movie and the credits) and the 4 adventure packs (chapters 23-26). `tools/pipelines/tour_ssa_story.sh <iso> <work dir>
[<level>...]` (~2 min 30 s a level, ~70 min for the 27; one instance, isolated, headless, silent): a new game started in
the level with `SKY_LEVEL` (chapter 1 is also the real flow: the harness's SSA run reaches it from the menus), the
figure `new_14.sky` on the emulated portal, B through the opening cutscene, then from 62 s walking, attacking, jumping
and the pause menu, stopped at 141 s. Pass: the level's `mission.str` opened (`SKY_TRACE_FILES`), no fault or `[guard]`
line, frames to the end, at least 60 s in the level (from its first frame), last shot not black
(`tools/pipelines/story_summary.py`). Result: **27 of 27 ok** (evidence: `private/ssa100/story/`, `summary.tsv`, a last
shot per level). **What it proves:** each level loads and runs 2 minutes without a fault. **What it does not:** play;
outside chapter 1 the `SKY_LEVEL` redirect creates no Skylander (no hero, no HUD in the end shots; Kaos' arena shows his
health bar but no hero), so the presses act on nothing ([100.md](100.md), "Modes").

| Chapter | Level | Name | Result | Boss (from the level's own text) |

- **With the hero (2026-10-28) [V].** The tour above used `SKY_LEVEL`, which reads level_027's files from another
  level's: each level loads and runs, but **no Skylander is created** outside level_027 (no hero, no HUD). The test
  switch `SKY_NEXT_LEVEL` makes the game itself go to the level (the opening movie's `nextLevel`,
  [str_levels_loading.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/engines/lux/str_levels_loading.md#which-level-a-new-game-starts-and-starting-another-one-lux-ssa-v)).
  `TOUR_MODE=hero TOUR_SECONDS=110 tools/pipelines/tour_ssa_story.sh <iso> <work dir> <levels...>`: **28 of 28 ok with
  the hero**, the 27 story levels and `level_hub` (the Ruins' first stage): each run 0 faults, 0 `[guard]`, ~90 s in
  the level, and the game wrote the figure back (its first-use write, made when the Skylander enters play; the
  summary's `hero` column), while with `SKY_LEVEL` the figure stays untouched outside level_027. A shot per level shows
  Gill Grunt's portrait, health bar and level in the corner (evidence: `private/ssa100/bosses/herotour/`,
  `hero_tour_sheet.png`).
- **Bosses.** Kaos' final fight starts on arrival (`level_010b`): reached and started [V]. The other bosses
  (column 5) wait at the end of their level, behind its puzzles: a script that walks and attacks blindly does not get
  there. The levels' own boss checkpoint (`checkBossFightCheckPoint`, `TeleportToBoss` in level_019) was found but
  editing it did not move the first spawn [?] (the leads: the engine page above). Left to a human
  ([playtest.md](playtest.md)) or that lead.
- **Heroic Challenges.** `SKY_NEXT_LEVEL=Challenge_Level_000` loads the challenge and runs it (its timer, "0 of 100"),
  but no Skylander appears: challenge levels hold no `Player` thing; the hero likely comes from the Ruins' challenge
  menu [?].
- **The ending and the credits.** `tools/pipelines/ssa_ending.sh <iso> <work dir>` (~11 min): a script cannot beat Kaos,
  so the test switch `SKY_MOVIE_SWAP=legal:sl_sc30,atvilogo:credit` ([debugging.md](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/forge/blob/main/docs/porting/debugging.md))
  makes the two first start-up movies the ending (`sl_sc30.bik`, 5025 frames, 167 s) and the credits roll
  (`credit.bik`, 13804 frames, 460 s). Both play to their own end in the game's movie player: `[movie] legal ended after
  5026 updates`, `[movie] atvilogo ended after 13799 updates` (`engines/lux/movie.cpp`), then the game goes on to its
  title; no fault; shots at 90 s (Kaos in the ending), 300 s and 600 s (the credits) look right [V]. What triggers them
  in the real flow (Kaos beaten) is not reached.

## Open problems
- The real portal and performance on the tester's Windows PC (Skylauncher issues #11, #12).
- A full playthrough by hand has not been done ([100.md](100.md), [playtest.md](playtest.md)); every story level loads and plays
  2 minutes, Kaos' final fight starts, the ending and credits play ("Story tour" above); the 2-hour soak is done ([100.md](100.md)).

## Difficulty (2026-10-28) [SSA] [V]
Spyro's Adventure has no difficulty to choose: a new game starts at once and Options (General, Audio, Controls) hold none, so
`nightmare_from_start` does nothing here (the runtime says so in the log). Swap Force's Nightmare is the one that is locked:
[its status](https://github.com/arkeyan-forge/swap-force/blob/main/docs/status.md), "Nightmare difficulty".
